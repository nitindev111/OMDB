1.Application is developed with following:
-ReactJs
-Webpack

2.Dist is the bundled folder which will be deployed.
-index.html
-client.min.js

3.This application has component based architecture.Which can be reused again and again in the whole application.

4Applications using ReactJs  can be build very efficiently with state management uisng "redux".But at this time point of time i have not used that.
